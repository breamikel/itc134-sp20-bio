My name is Brea Mikel. I'm an aspiring web developer and currently a student at Year Up. I call the Pacific Northwest home, but 
I'm originally from Palau. I aim to one day teach young pacific islanders how to code and to bring my community into the tech industry. 
In my spare  time I enjoy cooking, sewing, painting, and building websites.
